    "  Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and is used to hide the implementation details of an object while exposing only the essential features or functionalities to the outside world. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. By abstracting the implementation details, you create a clear and simplified interface for interacting with the object.\n"
